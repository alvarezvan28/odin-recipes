      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch
          round pans.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a
          large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one
          at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring
          and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl.
          Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until
          incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and
          pour into prepared pans.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
          comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
          Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a
          serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat,
          stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl
          with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour
          mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost
          cake layers when completely cool.re
